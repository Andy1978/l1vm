L1VM jit-library README
=======================
In this directory is the L1VM jit library.
The library can be compiled by my zerobuild tool:
https://github.com/koder77/zerobuild

Also the asmjit library is needed: https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit

The library libl1vm-jit.so must be installed into /usr/local/lib or
another library search path.
