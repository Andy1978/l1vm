L1VM README  2017-10-21
=======================

YES! I AM BACK! ;)

L1VM is a very tiny virtual machine with RISC (or comparable style) about 60 opcodes and less than
32 KB binary size on X86_64!
The VM has a 64 bit core (256 registers for integer and double float) and can run object code
written in the l1asm assembly language.

The design goals are:
- be small
- be fast
- be simple
- be modular

L1VM ist under active development. As a proof of concept I rewrote the Nano VM fractalix SDL graphics demo in L1VM
assembly.

I try to write a compiler for a higher level language. This is not a simple task, but maybe
it is worth the time invested...

I included a few demo programs.

The source code is released under the GPL.


Modules
=======
The VM modules should be installed into "/usr/local/lib".


NOTE
====
The current version of L1VM only runs on a Linux or other POSIX compatible OS!
If you want help to port it to a new OS, then contact me please...


TODO
====
- make the L1COM compiler a bit more comfortable
- write more functions for the modules
- more demo programs


USAGE
=====

compile
-------

$ l1com test

compiles program "test.l1com"

assemble
--------

$ l1asm test

assembles program "test.l1asm" generated by the compiler

run
---

$ l1vm test

finally executes program "test.l1obj"
